# Echotable
Echotable is a garbage application that was developed in a jiffy with terrible code practices in order to finish an exam project literally as fast as possible. 

The project is an MVC (Model-view-controller) platform made in C#, with scaffolding (The SQL part) which creates an SQL server for the project.
The SQL server and website is hosted internally through ISSExpress. 

**In order for the SQL scaffolding to work, you'll need to Update-Database.**
