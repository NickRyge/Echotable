# Echotable
Echotable is a garbage application that was developed in a jiffy with terrible code practices in order to finish an exam project literally as fast as possible. 

The project is an MVC (Model-view-controller) platform made in C#, with scaffolding (The SQL part) which creates an SQL server for the project.
The SQL server and website is hosted internally through ISSExpress. 

Database image is now referenced dynamically, and unless someone ruins my work, you should see a flag and a skiing man, on the front page.
